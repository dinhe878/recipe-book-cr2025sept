# Gnocchi alla Sorrentina
**Gnocchi alla Sorrentina** is an incredible Italian comfort food dish made with soft and light potato gnocchi baked in a rich and delicious tomato sauce with bubbling mozzarella cheese and fresh basil.

## Ingredients

- 1 lb potato gnocchi, see note 1 (500g)
- 28 oz canned pomodorini tomatoes, can also use crushed tomatoes (800g)
- 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 1 large handful fresh basil
- 8.8 oz mozzarella, roughly chopped or torn (2 balls / 250g)
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- Salt and pepper, to season

## Instructions

1. If making your own potato gnocchi follow this step by step guide alternatively use store bought.
2. Pre-heat the oven to 430F/220C.
3. Heat the olive oil to a large skillet, add the garlic and saute for 1-2 minutes until fragrant but not browned.
4. Next, add the canned pomodorini tomatoes with a good pinch of salt and pepper and simmer the sauce for 10 minutes breaking up the tomatoes enough so they burst open. Once simmered add half of the mozzarella (roughly chopped) and basil then stir to combine.
5. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the gnocchi until they float to the surface.
6. Remove the gnocchi with a slotted spoon and add to the tomato sauce, toss to coat. If your pan or skillet is not oven-proof then transfer the gnocchi to an oven-proof baking dish.
7. Top the gnocchi with the rest of the mozzarella and bake for 20 minutes until the mozzarella cheese is melted, bubbling and golden.
